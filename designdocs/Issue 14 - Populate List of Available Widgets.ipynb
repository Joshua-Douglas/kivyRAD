    "## Overview \n",

    "The visualizer is planned to support three visualization modes:\n",
    "1. Visualize updates to a standalone kvlang script\n",
    "2. Visualize updates to an existing kivy widget\n",
    "3. Visualize updates to an existing kivy application \n",
    "\n",
    "To allow the user to choose what to visualize, we should populate a listbox that displays each of the visualization options. The user will be able to select which item they would like to visualize. Switching between items will update the visualization. \n",

    "### How do you search a py file for class definitions?\n",
    "We need to find all App and Widget descendants within each python file. We cannot expect all widget types to be a direct descendant of known kivy types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `inspect` python module will return all of the base classes of a type, but this module requires live objects. We want to avoid executing the user's code, because this will require using their environment and we are trying to keep a clear separation between their environment and the kivy designer environment - plus actually executing their code can have some side effects. We should only do this execution during visualization, when they request it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we cannot we use the `ast` module to find all objects within a python file that descend from the `App` and `widget` class. The reason is that the AST tree only stores the direct class parents, and does not provide any reference to where those parents are declared. To build a more complete hierarchy tree we would need to search through all the available source files and build the hierarchy ourselves. \n"

    "1. Add a WidgetScanner class that can recursively search a file directory for `Widget` and `App` classes. The search should avoid compiling any code, so our plan is to use the abstract syntax tree\n",
    "    * The WidgetScanner class should accept the root file directory\n",
    "    * It should return the module filepath for each class type\n",
    "    * It should provide the four groups of widget types specified in the research section (kvfiles, user Apps, user widgets, kivy widgets)\n",
    "    * It should provide a mechanism to rescan file(s) on update, without rescanning the entire directory\n",
    "2. Use the WidgetScanner class to find all of the `Widget` and `App` within the `kivy` standard library (for the current version for now), and store these class names in a list\n",
    "3. Use the list of kivy standard library classes to improve the search within WidgetScanner. The WidgetScanner doesn't need to search up to the widget. It can stop at any of the standard library classes\n",
    "4. Our search will not be perfect since the ast does not provide detailed information about the parents. Since the ast does not state where the parent class is declared, our imperfect search will have a very small probability of returning false positive (if there is another class in another namespace with the same name as a kivy standard library widget), and we risk missing widgets if the widget descends from a third-party widget that is not present in the available source files. To account for these rare failures, we should provide attributes to explicitely enable and disable the visualization (@disable_kv_vis, @enable_kv_vis)\n",
    "5. Use a tree view to display the four groups\n",
    "  * Let's stylize the tree in a separate issue. I'd like to wait until the visualizer is able to help us here \n",
    "6. Add a on_submit event handler that will send the proper update instruction to the visualizer whenever an item is selected. Create some dummy instructions for now since hot reloading for class types is not yet implemented"

    "## Implementation Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "### How should `WidgetScanner` search a directory for widgets and apps?\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways we could approach this problem, using the `ast` to avoid inspecting compiled code:\n",
    "1. Build an inheritance graph using the source code from each of the source code files. An inheritance graph will have node connections across several source files, so each time a source code file is updated we will need to either rebuild the tree or cache additional information about each source file that will allow us to efficiently update the inheritance graph. Constructing an inheritance graph may also be expensive to build because python's inheritance rules are very loose - for example a class can inherit from a parent and that parent's parent. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Determine whether a class is a kivy widget/app as soon as it is encountered. This will require visiting the parent modules as soon as they are encountered. We could use memoization to reduce excessive source code compile calls. We can also limit the visited modules to files in the project. If we use this structure then we can update & refresh one file at a time without building an overall tree at each refresh. \n",
    "  * This way avoids the complexity of building a tree, but adds the complexity of needing to determine where ClassDef source code definitions are located using import statements. This is all technically possible (using functionality like `importlib.util.find_spec()`), but parsing import statements will be challenging and conducting multiple file parses per file could get expensive. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we encounter a ClassDef that has parents we will know nothing about that parent unless we've encountered it before. To determine if the parent is a widget/app we need to store its inheritance information in an inheritance tree. If we later find the parent's class definition contains a known widget/app or known non_kivy_class then we will know the child's status as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tree only needs to contain nodes with an unknown top-level ancestor. If the class is known to have no parents, or is known to be a kivy widget/app then simply add them to the known sets and move on.\n",
    "0. Create three sets: known_app_classes, known_widget_classes, known_non_kivy_classes\n",
    "1. Define node visitor to visit each ClassDef\n",
    "2. The ClassDef entry will represent a node on the inheritance graph - complete will all the parents for that class. \n",
    "3. Determine if the current entry is a known widget or app. If it is, then append it to the set of known widgets/apps. If the class has known_non_kivy_class parent then move it to that set and do not add it to the tree. \n",
    "4. Update the inheritance graph to:\n",
    "  i) Search the tree to determine if any of the parents are currently in the graph. \n",
    "    If they are then add the current node as a child. \n",
    "    If they are not, then add each parent node with current node as a child\n",
    "  ii) Search the tree to determine if the current entry is already present in the graph (without parents, of course). If the node is present, then two actions are possible:\n",
    "    I) If the current entry is a known widget/app then we now know that all of the children are also. Add them to the sets & trim them from the tree.\n",
    "    II) If the entry is not a known widget, then update the pre-existing node's parents to reflect the current entry.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that returns (app, widget, kvfile) lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure the search uses the new attributes\n",
