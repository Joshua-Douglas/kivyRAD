    "2. Visualize updates to an existing kivy widget\n",
    "3. Visualize updates to an existing kivy application \n",
    "\n",

    "We need to find all App and Widget descendants within each python file. We cannot expect all widget types to be a direct descendant of known kivy types. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `inspect` python module will return all of the base classes of a type, but this module requires live objects. We want to avoid executing the user's code, because this will require using their environment and we are trying to keep a clear separation between their environment and the kivy designer environment - plus actually executing their code can have some side effects. We should only do this execution during visualization, when they request it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately we cannot we use the `ast` module to find all objects within a python file that descend from the `App` and `widget` class. The reason is that the AST tree only stores the direct class parents, and does not provide any reference to where those parents are declared. To build a more complete hierarchy tree we would need to search through all the available source files and build the hierarchy ourselves. \n"
